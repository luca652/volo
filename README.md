Volo helps parents of bilingual children find other bilingual families, so that the children can practice their parentâ€™s mother tongue.


A user can find groups of families who speak the same language and ask to join the group.

In the kids' section, children can use the "Story Generator". When they enter prompts for a story, the app creates and sends a request to the ChatGPT API, which sends back a title and a story based on the prompts entered.
